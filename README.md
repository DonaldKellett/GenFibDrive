# GenFibProvider

A simple PSProvider using [SHiPS](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SHiPS/0.8.1) for generating Fibonacci sequences of the nth order, for illustration purposes only

## Supported Platforms

The module has been tested with PowerShell version 5.1.19041.906 on Windows 10 (32-bit) Build 19042.928, though it should work with any sufficiently recent PowerShell version on a sufficiently recent build of Windows 10 on both 32 and 64-bit systems. If you're using PowerShell Core on macOS / Linux (for whatever reason), [YMMV](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ymmv).
